## Menu bar

The menubar adapts to whichever application in focus. All applications in *Karaqu* has a few menu entries 
that automatically comes with attached functionality. One of them is "About" entry -
[when clicked]($sys:about|{"type":"show-app","ns":"sys","app":"manual"}), this entry
will invoke a small dialog window, displaying information about the application. Here you will find who the author is,
the size, version, license of the software. Additionaly, you can check out the source code of the application,
download it and see instrcutions of how to run it locally yourself on your own computer.

Another entry that is automatically available is "Help" - when clicked *Karaqu* will show you help documentation
of the application in question. Initially, this document might not be fully complete - it is up to the author of
the application to add proper documentation.

If no application is in focus, the menubar will show system menu.
