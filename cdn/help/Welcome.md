# Welcome

When personal computers were introduced 50+ years ago our lives looked completely 
different. We spent most of our days behind a desk and mobile phones didnâ€™t exist. 
Today our lives are far more mobile and we have taken small steps to move our applications
and data into the cloud. **Karaqu** allows you to take a giant leap into the future and
become completely cloud-based.

**Karaqu** moves everything online! All your applications, 
documents, photos, music and all other files are online - you can access them no matter where you are,
from any computer or mobile phone.

### Look &amp; Feel
---
You can adapt **Karaqu** to your likings in [System Preferences]($preferences|{"type":"go-to","view":"general"}).
Here you can select wallpapers best fitting your taste as well as appearance themes.
Additionally you can select among 50 different screensavers.
Below is just a few of themes available.

 * [Karaqu Dark]($gui/-o/karaqu-dark)
 * [Royale Purple]($gui/-o/royale-purple)
 * [Royale Amber]($gui/-o/royale-amber)
 * [Frosted Glass]($gui/-o/glass-frosted)
 * [Distorted Glass]($gui/-o/glass-distorted)


### Invite friends
---
**Karaqu** is now in beta phase. You can invite friends, family &amp; co-workers by sending
them inivitations with [System Preferences]($preferences|{"type":"go-to","view":"invitations"}).
By adding a friend as a contact, you can [chat]($chat) or make [video calls]($bell) using
[Peer-to-Peer](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) technology. This means the exchange of data
is explicitly between you and your contact - without **Karaqu** servers in between.
<br/><br/>

### Cloud Architecture
---
**Karaqu** is built with modern cloud native architecture - using microservices, the system is 
self-scaling to maintain predefined high-level performance on the server cluster it is running upon. 
Of course, you can work offline at any time - the system will auto-sync whenever your computer is 
connected to the internet.

**Karaqu** is deployed atop CapEx light public cloud infrastructure. Without regard to the 
underlying infrastructure, a **Karaqu** experience is always identical. You will experience a 
single-action interface which delivers a secure, sophisticated and high fidelity interface.
<br/><br/>

### Open Source
---
Applications deployed in **Karaqu** are open source at Github. In order to facilitate 
development, **Karaqu** offers a well-tested command line tool - making processes such 
as scaffolding new applications, testing and development and deployment - simpler than 
ever seen before on any existing platform.

**Karaqu** features an open, powerful, stable and versatile development environment. With the 
click of a mouse button you can get started with creating applications for yourself, a 
group of people or even everyone.

of commitment since 2019 in the hope that it will be of use to you. If you
