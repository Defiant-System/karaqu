Defian System AB manages your personal data in association with your purchase of our products 
and the provision of our services at <a href="//defiantsystem.com">defiantsystem.com</a> and other
<b>Karaqu</b> related applications that are made accessible by us.
<br/><br/>
Your privacy is key to us and we always want to make sure that you feel safe and informed 
when using our services. This privacy policy is intended to give you all the information you 
need (and which you are entitled to) on how we collect and process your personal data by 
visiting or using our services. 
<br/><br/>
We fully understand if you do not wish to share your personal data with us. Unfortunately, 
you will then not be able to use our services and purchase our products online as this requires 
certain sharing of data. An option is also to have a look at the privacy settings of your web 
browser â€“ perhaps that will make you feel more secure.

Also, be aware that our websites might contain links to third party sites. We cannot take 
responsibility for anyone but ourselves and these sites will not be subject to this policy. 
We do not endorse and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content on these sites.
