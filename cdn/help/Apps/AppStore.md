## Application Store

Using [AppStore]($appstore), you can easily botanise available applications in **Karaqu**. The
purpose of this application is to facilitate for users to find what they are looking for but also give
and indication of the progress of its development.

### No Install, No Upgrade

As you might already know, there is no installation, upgrade of applications in **Karaqu** - just run it.
This is the reason there is only `Open` button. When opening an application, you will always get
the latest version automatically. All applications are very small in size and any usage will affect
your **Karaqu** cloud storage - hence there is no _uninstallation_ either.

### Green Software

As mentioned above, applications in **Karaqu** are very small as oppose to your traditional software -
that can be anything from **20 MB**, up to **2-3 GB** on your hard disk. Smaller applications downloads
faster, use less energy globally, consequently enviromentally friendly.
